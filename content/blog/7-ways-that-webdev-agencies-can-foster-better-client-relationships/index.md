New business rarely walks through the door completely unannounced.

Often, you have to spend weeks preparing, pitching, and planning for a project, before you can even write a single line of code. And if you aren't careful, all that effort could be in vain.

But did you know that one of the best sources of new business is already _right in front of you_?

Whether helping you grow your network through referrals, or booking you back in for another brief, existing clients are the gatekeepers of exciting new revenue — so you _need_ to make sure they have a great experience.

Here’s how you do it.

# Establish roles and goals from the get-go

Let’s say you've been introduced, referred, or otherwise connected to a new client. They explain their problem and it looks like your agency can help.

Before you jump into the project, start by laying the foundations of an effective client-agency relationship by aligning expectations from day one. This is also incredibly useful when working with existing or past clients, who may be trying a new style of project with you or working to a different time frame.

The simplest way to do this is to **create an instruction manual for working with your agency.** It should detail how you like to work, your expectations from your clients, your strengths, and even your weaknesses.

By being open and transparent from the start of the project, you'll avoid misunderstandings and confusion by preventing issues before they occur.

For example, your client might expect weekly demos throughout the project, but your team works in monthly iterations — you need to let them know.

So what goes in the instruction manual?

Writing your manual will be an individual process unique to your agency, but it should focus on aligning expectations, avoiding common issues, and showing how great it'll be to work with your agency.

If your client has _different_ expectations, these can be flagged and resolved before the project begins, avoiding potential communication errors and confusion.

**Start by answering the questions below:**

- Who will be responsible for communicating with the client?
- How will communication be managed and recorded? Do you prefer email, telephone, or dedicated project management software?
- How do you share progress with your client?
- How do you expect feedback to be sent?
- How does your billing process work? If you charge hourly, how is work evidenced?
- How is development managed and planned? Are you waterfall, agile, or something else? How does this benefit the client?
- Any other frequently asked questions about your working practices.

# Use plain English

Webdev agencies do complicated work and development teams need to use technical terms to describe what is going on. But when speaking or writing to \_a client \_about a technical subject, you should avoid unnecessary jargon wherever you can — remember your audience.

**If you must use a technical term or concept, define it immediately afterward or give a helpful analogy by relating it to something your client already knows.**

Switching to plain English, from industry-specific buzzwords and tech speak, will improve your client relationships because your contact:

- Will understand what is going on and be able to give constructive feedback
- Will fe fully informed and therefore trust you
- Will have confidence in your abilities
- … and will have the language to _promote_ those abilities within their professional circle.

# Be proactive and transparent

In a bad client-agency relationship, your client is constantly chasing you for updates on progress and waiting days for a reply.

In a great client-agency relationship, the agency is proactive. This means frequently reaching out to your clients and keeping them updated on progress or issues.

**By keeping your client in the loop when things are good, you'll earn their trust. When issues arise, you can use this trust to work together to resolve issues.**

# Adopt agile best practices

The Agile Manifesto was written by a team of 17 developers in 2001, aiming to create an alternative to existing software development processes, which they saw as complicated, slow, and too focused on documentation.

Whether your team has adopted agile or not, the Agile Manifesto contains [<u>12 principles</u>](https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/12-principles-behind-the-agile-manifesto/) that are helpful to any modern web development agency — particularly when it comes to fostering better client relationships.

## Deliver value early and often

_"Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software."_

Web development projects are often long and complicated, but with careful planning, you can deliver constant value throughout the process.

Rather than waiting until the end of the project for a big reveal, break the project down into stages — delivering value in each. This way, not only does the client feel supported step-by-step, they’ve also got ample opportunity to feed back in an iterative way.

Feedback delivered late is difficult (and frustrating!) to respond to. While timely feedback keeps everyone aligned, satisfied and motivated to get the job done.

## Business and development aligned

_“Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.”_

For many agencies, the individual or team that _won_ the project, and the individual or team who _manages_ the client, is often _entirely separate_ from the development team. And this can be a recipe for disaster when it comes to happy client relationships:

- Unless right hand leaves _nothing_ out when speaking to left, unrecorded requirements discovered during the sales process can end up lost — frustrating your client when their needs are not met
- Client feedback is communicated by a game of 'telephone', with the account or project manager acting as a middle man between webdev and the client contact. At best, the feedback process results in a game of Chinese Whispers and, at worst, the project risks breaking down on account of inefficient feedback.
- Developer questions must also be communicated by 'telephone', leading to miscommunication, slower development and — ultimately — increased costs.

The Agile Manifesto suggests a solution: collocating your business teams _and_ development teams in the same area, to enable free-flowing communication.

By coming together, development and business teams will pick up relevant information passively. For example, when one developer asks a question about the goals of the project, others in the room can be involved in the discussion or simply overhear.

In the case of remote teams, interdepartmental channels of communication need to be _wide_ open to avoid anything slipping through the net.

## Aim for simplicity

_"Simplicity — the art of maximizing the amount of work not done — is essential."_

In Agile, simplicity means building the neatest solution that _might_ meet the requirements of your client, then incrementally building upon it until your client is satisfied.

This has several benefits for client-agency relationships:

- Encourages regular feedback on work, improving communications
- Reduces time spent on potentially over-complicated solutions, reducing client spend
- Writing less code means fewer bugs, leading to less negative feedback.

# Level up client relationships today, reap the rewards tomorrow

The benefits of focusing on client relationships are _huge_.

By reflecting on the quality of your client-company dynamics, and actively working to improve them, you'll build meaningful relationships with your customers, leading to greater, more effective collaboration _and_ further pitches and briefs in the future.

While it may feel like you’ve got to go out chasing new leads, there’s plenty to be done from where you are today — and it doesn’t cost a penny in marketing spend!
