Thanks for playing with FeaturePeek! 

It looks like you're about to submit a pull request. All open pull requests appear on the homepage of featurepeek.com, so please be mindful and courteous about your contribution. 

After you submit your pull request and CI passes, FeaturePeek will spin up an environment containing your changes. A link to that environment will appear on the pull request page.

Protip: include the text `@featurepeek <path>` in your pull request body to make the link to your environment point to a specific path. For example, to point to the Pricing page, you'd write `@featurepeek /pricing` on a line by itself.
