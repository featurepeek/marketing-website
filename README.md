## Introduction

This is the GitHub repository for the front-end source code of [featurepeek.com](https://featurepeek.com). It's integrated with FeaturePeek, so you can get an understanding of how to integrate your own front-end projects simply by poking around in this one. 

There are two files in particular to pay attention to:

- [peek.yaml](https://github.com/featurepeek/marketing-website/blob/dev/peek.yaml): This is the project config file -- it's how you indicate which of your organization's repositories you'd like to spin up on FeaturePeek. 
- [.circleci/config.yml](https://github.com/featurepeek/marketing-website/blob/dev/.circleci/config.yml#L71): This project uses [CircleCI](https://circleci.com) for Continuous Integration, but you can bring along any other CI service. Take a look at this file to see how easy it is to set up FeaturePeek in your CI pipeline. 

**You are encouraged to make pull requests!** Fork this project, make a change, and submit your change as a pull request. You'll see your change in the Demo section of [featurepeek.com](https://featurepeek.com). See the [Contributing](#contributing) section for more detail.

## Contributing

All open pull requests appear on the homepage of [featurepeek.com](https://featurepeek.com), so please be mindful and courteous about your contribution. 

After you submit your pull request and CI passes, FeaturePeek will spin up an environment containing your changes. A link to that environment will appear on the pull request page.

> **Protip:** include the text `@featurepeek <path>` in your pull request body to make the link to your environment point to a specific path. For example, to point to the Pricing page, you'd write `@featurepeek /pricing` on a line by itself in the pull request body.
