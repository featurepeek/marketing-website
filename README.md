## Introduction

This is the GitHub repository for the front-end source code of [featurepeek.com](https://featurepeek.com). It's integrated with FeaturePeek, so you can get an understanding of how to integrate your own front-end projects simply by poking around in this one. 

There are two files in particular to pay attention to:

- [peek.yml](https://github.com/featurepeek/marketing-website/blob/dev/peek.yml): This is the project config file -- it's how you indicate which of your organization's repositories you'd like to spin up on FeaturePeek. 
- [.circleci/config.yml](https://github.com/featurepeek/marketing-website/blob/dev/.circleci/config.yml#L71): This project uses [CircleCI](https://circleci.com) for Continuous Integration, but you can bring along any other CI service. Take a look at this file to see how easy it is to set up FeaturePeek in your CI pipeline.
